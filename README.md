This repository demonstrates a common error encountered when using the Expo Camera API: an unhandled permission request. The `bug.js` file shows the incorrect implementation, resulting in the error. The `bugSolution.js` file provides the corrected code, properly handling the permission request and displaying the camera feed only after permission is granted.  The issue is related to not properly requesting and handling camera permissions within the application.
